## What's in there?

My config for my Mouseless Development Environment. I am using the lightweight and effective combo:

* arch linux
* i3 / dmenu / dunst
* Neovim
* tmux
* zsh
* git / [diff-so-fancy](https://github.com/so-fancy/diff-so-fancy)

All my config files are in this repository except:

1. My development project configurations
2. My config install settings

## WARNING

There are no backup system. If you install this on top of your dotfiles, expect a big mess.
You shouldn't use the `install.sh` script. You should only pick whatever you want and include it in your own config.
