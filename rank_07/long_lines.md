But it's also true that Vim takes time to master. You can improve your workflow each time you use Vim if you want to. It's a benefit, not a drawback. To me, Vim is the gamification of writing: I can focus on my writing 90% of the time, and I'll spend the last 10% messing around, trying to make my editing power even greater while having fun.

Use Vim, I said!
